# Data-Engineering-Capstone-ATP-Tennis

This repository contains data engineering code and analysis of historical ATP tennis world tour data from 2000 to 2022. The project explores various aspects of the data, such as player performance, match outcomes, and tournament trends. The code includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques. The project aims to provide insights into the world of professional tennis and develop data-driven models for predicting match outcomes.

## Technologies used

- Airflow: A workflow management platform used to orchestrate and automate data pipelines.
- Apache Beam: A unified programming model for batch and streaming data processing.
- PostgreSQL: An open-source relational database management system used to store and manage data.
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS): A scalable and durable object storage service for storing and accessing data.
- BigQuery: A fully managed, serverless data warehouse for large-scale data analytics.
- Pub/Sub: A fully managed real-time messaging service for communication between applications.
- Data Build Tool (DBT): A data transformation tool used to create and manage data transformations in SQL.

## Docker

To ensure consistent and reproducible development and deployment environments, this project utilizes Docker containers. Dockerfiles are provided for building custom images for each component of the data pipeline. These images encapsulate the necessary dependencies and configurations for running the code in a consistent and isolated manner. This approach facilitates portability and reproducibility across different development and production environments.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is obtained from the ATP Tennis Rankings, Results, and Stats repository on GitHub [https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). This repository contains a comprehensive collection of ATP match results, player rankings, and biographical information. The data is provided in CSV format and spans from 1968 to the present. However, for this project, the focus is on a 20-year period between 2000 and 2019, using men's singles data on the ATP tour only (excluding doubles and ATP futures/challenger series).

## Motivation and Business case

Professional tennis is a highly competitive and data-driven sport. Understanding player performance, match outcomes, and tournament trends can provide valuable insights for coaches, players, and fans. Data engineering plays a crucial role in collecting, processing, and analyzing large amounts of tennis data. This capstone project aims to demonstrate the application of data engineering techniques to ATP tennis data, providing insights and potential business opportunities.

### Potential business applications

- Player development: Identifying key performance indicators and patterns that contribute to player success can inform training strategies and optimize player development programs.

- Match prediction: Developing data-driven models for predicting match outcomes can provide valuable information for betting, sports journalism, and fan engagement.

- Tournament analysis: Analyzing tournament data can help identify factors that influence tournament attendance, sponsorship revenue, and overall success.

- Fan engagement: Creating data-driven visualizations and interactive dashboards can enhance fan engagement and provide personalized recommendations for matches and players.

This capstone project demonstrates the potential of data engineering to transform the way tennis data is analyzed and utilized, leading to valuable insights and business opportunities.
